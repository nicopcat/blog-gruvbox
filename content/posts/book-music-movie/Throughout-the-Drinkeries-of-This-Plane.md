那些智力超常的人啊  
认为已经  
熟悉了云和闪电的脾气  
就不再迷惑  
就不必了解自己，  
世界和他人  
每天只管  
被微风吹拂，与猛虎谈情  
   
他们从来不需要楼梯  
只有窗口  
把一切交付于梦境    
和优美的浪潮    
<mark>在这颗行星所有的酒馆    
青春、自由似乎理所应得  
面向涣散的未来  
只唱情歌，看不到坦克</mark>    
    
在科学和啤酒都不能  
安抚的夜晚  
他们丢失了四季  
惶惑之行开始    
在这颗行星所有的酒馆    
都无法听到远方的呼喊    
野心勃勃的灯火  
瞬间吞没黑暗的脸庞

## Throughout the Drinkeries of This Planet
>Translated by Ji Geng, the lyric writer and bass of Omnipotent Youth Society, and a college professor in English.


Those of extraordinary intellect  
believe they have already   
acquainted themselves with the disposition of cloud and lighting,   
and thus shall be puzzled no longer 
and thus need not comprehend themselves,    
the world, or their fellow man. 
Their daily concerns are reduced to 
the caresses from breezes and the flirtations with bestial things.  
    
They require no stair,  
but only a window,  
and consign their worlds to dreamscape  
and to the resplendent tide.    
Throughout all the drinkeries of this planet    
youth and freedom are all but taken for granted;    
Facing the haphazard future,    
singing only love songs, they do not see the tanks. 
    
On a night when neither science nor drinks is of consolation    
they are disembodies from the seasons,  
and commence an uneasy journey. 
Throughout all the drinkeries of planet 
the far away call cannot be heard.  
The ambitious lamplight 
suddenly swallows the sullen faces.
